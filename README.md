  - Framework: Flask.  

- **Client-Side**:
- - Language: TypeScript.
  - Framework: Angular 12.
  - Major third-party:
    * Leaflet - a JavaScript library that integrated into the client-side for interactive maps.
    * Open Source Map (OSM) - OSM provides map data for a rich and customizable mapping  with routing abilities

- **Databases**:
  - Neo4J: The application utilizes a Neo4J graph database to efficiently store and query track information.
  - PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used for site operations, ensuring robust and reliable data management.
